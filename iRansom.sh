On initial inspection, the attached infected file looks like a PDF, however, it is a zip archive.Once infiltrated, PadCrypt encrypts various files (photos, videos, etc.) using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. It adds .padcrypt extension to the encrypted files. A .txt file is then created containing a message stating that the victim must pay a ransom, otherwise the files will remain encrypted forever. It is stated that the user must pay a .8 BitCoin ransom (at time of research, equivalent to $329.19). There are three ways for victims to pay the ransom: BitCoins; Ukash Voucher, and; Paysafecard. If the ransom is not paid within 96 hours, the private key (used to decrypt the files) is destroyed and decryption will become impossible. PadCrypt is quite unusual ransomware, since it allows users to decrypt files free of charge - they simply have to wait for six months and contact the developers of the ransomware . In addition, PadCrypt provides victims with live support - by answering all questions and guiding victims through the payment process. Cyber criminals gradually increase the amount of payments required. Finally, the developers allow victims to uninstall this ransomware, however, this does not decrypt the files - it simply removes the malware.

The developers of CryptoMix state that the RSA-2048 encryption algorithm is used for encryption. This is an asymmetric encryption process and, therefore, two keys (public and private) are generated during encryption - public to encrypt, and private to decrypt. Unfortunately, the private key is stored on remote servers controlled by cyber criminals.

  echo -en  "${yellow} [+] Details : ${gray}Cyber criminals have started using famous politicians‚Äô names to create malicious software. One of their newest products is Angela Merkel Ransomware, which shares similarities with Exotic Ransomware since it is created on its engine. Even though Angela Merkel Ransomware has just appeared on the web, it does not differ much from those older threats because it also performs the detection and encryption of personal files users keep on their computers. It has been found that it starts encrypting %USERPROFILE%\Desktop first, then goes to lock files in %USERPROFILE% and its subfolders, and, finally, it returns to check the directory %USERPROFILE%\Desktop one more time. Just like other ransomware infections, it then tries to persuade users that the only way to unlock those files is to purchase the decryption key. Since Angela Merkel Ransomware does not work properly yet (it might still be in the development mode, or it is poorly made), it is impossible to transfer money to cyber criminals and get the decryption tool. In fact, it is not a good idea to transfer money even if you are reading this article after some time when Angela Merkel Ransomware is fixed and works the way it should. The reason is one ‚Äì cyber criminals might not send you the decryptor after receiving money. The refund will not be issued either. Once Angela Merkel Ransomware finishes encrypting files (they will all have a new filename extension .angelamerkel) it finds on the computer, it opens a window containing the ransom note. It informs users about the encryption of files and tells them that the decryption key costs 1200 EUR. The payment has to be made in Bitcoins. As has already been mentioned, it is impossible to transfer money to cyber criminals because they have not left the Bitcoin address. Actually, you do not even need to send money to crooks to recover your files because it might be possible to get them back without the special key. In order to recover personal data, users must have copies of their files. These files could be easily transferred to the computer after the removal of Angela Merkel Ransomware. Unfortunately, it is impossible to retrieve data if its backup does not exist. If you are not planning on paying money to cyber criminals and do not have a backup of your important files, you should use alternative data recovery tools or wait until software developers release a free decryptor.${end}"

In any case, decryption without a unique key is impossible.Cyber criminals store this key on a remote server and victims are encouraged to pay hundreds of dollars to receive it. Despite these demands, cyber criminals should never be trusted.Research shows that these people often ignore victims, despite submitted payment - paying does not guarantee that your files will ever be decrypted and it is highly probable that you will be scammed.

  echo -en  "${yellow} [+] Details : ${gray}File extension Dexter is used by a variant of ransomware called Troldesh which much like other similar threats encrypts users files and demands bitcoins as ransom. It is distributed via .zip files downloaded from internet links provided in a spam email.Troldesh is a family of ransomware-type viruses. Malware from this family is created using a 'development kit', which various affiliates utilize with their payment email addresses, and then distribute to infect as many computers as possible.After system infiltration, these viruses encrypt victims' files using an asymmetric encryption algorithm (for example, RSA-2048) and modify the filenames. For instance, if the original file copy was named filesample.jpg, it would be renamed to filesample.jpg.[VICTIM'S ID].[DEVELOPERS' EMAIL].xtbl.Never variants of this ransomware use .dexter and .crypted000007 extensions for encrypted files. These viruses also change the desktop wallpaper and create a number of text files (named, for example, How to decrypt your files.txt), placing them in each folder containing the encrypted files.The text file and desktop wallpaper state that the victim must use the email address provided to restore compromised data. A reply is then received stating that the victim must pay a ransom to receive a decryption key. Payment instructions are also provided.This ransom must be paid in Bitcoins (BTC), and the size usually fluctuates between 0.5 and 1.5 BTC (at time of research, 1 BTC was equivalent to $538.06). Be aware, however, that cyber criminals often ignore victims, despite payments made. Therefore, you should never attempt to contact these criminals or pay any ransom. Two keys - public (encryption) and private (decryption) - are generated when encrypting files with the asymmetric algorithm. Decryption without the private key is impossible.${end}"

Trojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Pletor
Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Rotor
Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Lamer
and Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Cryptokluchen 

Rakhni is high-risk trojan/ransomware distributed using spam emails. Users receive an email letter containing a message (in Russian) encouraging them to open an attached .PDF document, which is presented as an "act of reconciliation". This is deceptive - in fact, the attachment is a malicious executable written in the Delphi programming language.Once opened, this executable downloads and installs Rakhni malware. Research shows that most infected machines are located in Russia - unsurprising, due to the Russian email text and that non Russian-speaking users are likely to delete these emails without opening attachments.Rakhni is an advanced virus. The malicious attachment performs a number of steps before infecting the system. Firstly, it displays an error message stating that the Adobe Reader plug-in is not found and, therefore, the .PDF file cannot be opened. This tricks users into believing that the attachment is simply broken, however, this is not the case.After displaying the pop-up, the downloader checks if the operating system is running on a virtual machine. If so, the infection process is terminated immediately. If the test "passes", the downloader "decides" whether to install a cryptocurrency miner or a file encrypter.${end}"

During encryption, Gremit appends file names with the ".rnsmwr" extension (e.g., "sample.jpg" is renamed to "sample.jpg.rnsmwr"). A pop-up window containing a ransom-demand message is then displayed.The Gremit message states that files are encrypted and that users must pay a ransom to restore them. The cost is .03 Bitcoin (currently equivalent to ~$21). This price is relatively low as compared to other viruses of the same type ransomware developers usually demand hundreds or even thousands of dollars.They encrypt files using symmetric/asymmetric encryption algorithms and, thus, decryption can only be performed with a unique key stored by cyber criminals on a remote server.Therefore, victims are encouraged to pay for this key. Furthermore, Gremit deletes one file every four hours. This ransomware supposedly deletes all stored files within 24 hours following infection.This, to ensure victims to submit their payments promptly. Be aware, however, that cyber criminals often ignore victims, despite payments made. Therefore, it is probable that you will be scammed. Paying does not guarantee that your files will ever be restored and is equivalent to sending your money to cyber criminals - you will simply support their malicious businesses. For these reasons, you should never attempt to contact these people or pay any ransom. ${end}"

During encryption, LockLock appends the names of encrypted files with a ".locklock" extension (for example, "sample.jpg" is renamed to "sample.jpg.locklock").Following successful encryption, LockLock changes the desktop background and creates a text file ("READ_ME.txt"), placing it on the desktop.Both the desktop wallpaper and text file contain similar messages informing victims of the encryption. Unlike regular ransomware-type viruses, however, LockLock does not demand any ransom. Victims simply need to send their Computer ID (provided within the text file) to the email address provided (locklockrs@aol.com), or via Skype (locklockrs).Victims then receive a free decryption tool used to restore the files. There is even an official YouTube video showing how to decrypt the files. This behavior is unusual to ransomware. Cyber criminals usually encrypt files and demand hundreds of dollars in exchange for the decrypter (or the private key used to restore files encrypted using asymmetric algorithms).${end}"

Following successful encryption, FileLocker creates two files: 1) "UserFilesLocker.exe", placing it on the desktop, and; 2) "_encrypt.pinfo", placing it in each folder containing encrypted files.The FileLocker executable is a pop-up window that contains a ransom-demand message in Czech. Therefore, it is safe to assume that FileLocker's developers target users from the Czech Republic, however, it this does not mean that users from other countries are safe.The executable contains four tabs. The first ("Informace") informs victims of the encryption and makes ransom demands. It is stated that the files can only be restored using unique keys. Unfortunately, this information is accurate. As mentioned above, FileLocker employs the AES-256 and RSA-2048 algorithms.Therefore, two unique decryption keys (one to decrypt files and another to decrypt the first key) are generated. Criminals store these keys on a remote server and victims are encouraged to pay a ransom of 0.85 Bitcoin (currently, 1 Bitcoin is equivalent to ~$1200) to receive them.${end}"
